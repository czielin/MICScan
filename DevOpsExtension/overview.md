The extension allows the MICScan application to be added to a DevOps pipeline in order to scan for vulnerabalities during a build. It can be configured to either raise a warning when a vulnerability is detected, or fail the build altogether.

This extension is in preview. There are still some known bugs and some errors may be seen during execution.
